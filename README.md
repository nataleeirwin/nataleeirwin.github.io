# Welcome to my CIT 281 portfolio

CIT 281 is the third course in the Computer Information and Technology minor. It is focused on cross-platform web app development and utilizes technologies such as Node.js, Git, Postman, Fastify, and VSCode. The course also teaches more advanced JavaScript by creating labs and projects designed to push students to apply the new skills discussed in lecture. 

Over the course of 10 weeks we have completed nine labs and seven projects, all of which can be found below.

## Projects and labs completed in Spring 2021:
